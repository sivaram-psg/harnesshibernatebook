Thanks for downloading the example code for Harnessing Hibernate (an
updated and expanded version of Hibernate: A Developer's Notebook).
The examples all rely on the Maven Tasks for Ant being available to
your Ant installation. To install Maven Tasks for Ant, drop the
maven-ant-tasks-2.0.8.jar file (found in the lib directory of this
download) into the lib directory of your Ant installation.

If you haven't installed Ant yet, see the first part of Chapter 1 for
instructions on where to find it.

Once you've successfully set up Ant, you should have an ANT_HOME
environment variable. Copy the maven-ant-tasks-2.0.8.jar file to
ANT_HOME/lib.

On Windows you can do this by running:

  copy lib\maven-ant-tasks-2.0.8.jar %ANT_HOME%\lib

On Unix (bash), you can do this by running:

  cp lib/maven-ant-tasks-2.0.8.jar ${ANT_HOME}/lib
